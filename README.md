# YouTube Title Video

## Easily embed your most viewed or most recent video!

### Quick Start:
  Example: https://youtube-title-video.herokuapp.com/v1/watch/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw (PewDiePie's Most recent video)

### Options:
  Video Options
    - Most Recent (default)
      - ?order=date 
    - Most Viewed
      - ?order=viewcount

### Inspiration
People with their own websites should be able to embed their most recent or popular video easily.  
This solution removes the need to have a backend server and doesn't expose a YouTube API key in the client's browser.
